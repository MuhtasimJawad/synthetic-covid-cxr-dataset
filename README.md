This repository is part of the supplementary materials for our paper titled *Synthesis of COVID-19 Chest X-rays using Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation* accepted for publication in the Journal of 
Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM).

## Dataset Details

The dataset consists of 21,295 synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray images. Images are generated using an unsupervised domain adaptation approach by leveraging class conditioning and adversarial training. Implementation of the algorithm is available [here](https://github.com/hasibzunair/adversarial-lesions).
