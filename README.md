A public dataset for synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray cases.

### Data Generation Pipeline


Contains 21,295 synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray images. Original data from [RSNA Kaggle Dataset](https://academictorrents.com/details/95588a735c9ae4d123f3ca408e56570409bcf2a9) and [COVID-19 Image Data Collection](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) which are publicly avaiable and can be downloaded from the URLs.

    Figure 1. Given any two unordered image collections, the generative algorithm learns to automatically translate an image from one  into  the  other: (left) Normal to (right) COVID-19; (left) Pneumonia to (right) COVID-19.

The synthetic COVID-19 CXR images are generated using this conditional image synthesis [algorithm](https://github.com/hasibzunair/adversarial-lesions), validation study [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06824).
